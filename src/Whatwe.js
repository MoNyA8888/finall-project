              Classes throughout the program are divided into two, computer
              science (CS) classes and design thinking classes (DT).
              <br></br>
              These two together allow students to strategically analyze
              problems, come with creative solutions and utilize technology and
              programming to implement these solutions.
            </p>
          </body1>
          <br></br>
          At the end of each summer camp, students are asked to look for
          problems in their environment, use design thinking techniques to find
          solutions and execute these solutions through programming.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          These projects are mixed between group work and individual projects.
          This mix is very essential in improving students’ potential in dealing
          with various working environments and student’s teamwork and
          communication skills.

          DT refers to the cognitive, strategic and practical processes by which
          design concepts (proposals for new products, buildings, machines,
          etc.) are developed. The core aim of DT is to understand people’s
          needs and creatively offer solutions to meet these needs. Accordingly,
          students are exposed to 5 non-linear steps that make up the core of
          design thinking. Empathise// Define//Ideate//Prototype//Test These
          steps allow s<br></br>

          <br></br>
          <h2>1. Empathising:</h2>
          Firstly, students are taught how to better and understand problems,
          people’s needs and challenges involved. This is viable through
          teaching students how to observe, engage and empathize with people to
          understand their experiences and motivations, as well as immersing
          students in the physical environment so you can gain a deeper personal
          understanding of the issues involved.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          <h2>2-Defining:</h2>
          Then students are taught how to analyze and synthesise gathered
          information in order to define main problems and challenges. This
          process should end a human-centred problem statement that describes
          the problem.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          <h2>3- Ideating: </h2>
          In this stage, students should generate as many ideas as possible
          should be diverse and should not be restricted to a certain
          methodology or approach. At the end of this process, students are
          taught how to filter these ideas through certain measures, and so they
          should leave this stage with ideas ready for prototyping.

          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          <h2>4-Prototyping:</h2>
          In this process, students should build their own mini, inexpensive
          versions of their solution or specific features in it, this process
          helps them gain a better understanding of the capabilities, problems
          and real users’ usage of their solution. Finally, this process should
          allow students to come up with the fittest mini version of their
          solution.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          <h2>5-Testing:</h2>
          In this stage, students learn how to rigorously test their complete
          product. Usually, this process would give a clearer understanding of
          of the users, the conditions of use, how people think, behave, and
          feel, and to empathise. Even during this phase, alterations and
          refinements are made in order to rule out problem solutions and derive
          as deep an understanding of the product and its users as possible.

        <h1>*computer sience:</h1>
        <h2>Year one : </h2>
        Learning basic programming fundamentals. In year one students use Python
        (Turtle library) to learn the fundamentals, then they use the knowledge
        gained to make their own first game !<h2>Year Two:</h2>
        in year Two thay're learn two diffrent language code first "html" to
        make a perfect website then they're gonna learn a java script to make a
        app mobile
        <h2>Year three:</h2>
        in the last year they're learn react.js to make a website and app in the
        same time ,using javaScript and Material-ui.
